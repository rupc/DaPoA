# Sui Explorer Frontend

[Sui Explorer](https://explorer.sui.io/) is a network explorer for the Sui network, similar in functionality to [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/) or [Solana Explorer](https://explorer.solana.com/). Use Sui Explorer to see the latest transactions and objects.

# Set Up

**Requirements**: Node 14.0.0 or later.

Dependencies are managed using [`pnpm`](https://pnpm.io/). You can start by installing dependencies in the root of the Sui repository:

```
$ pnpm install
```

> All `pnpm` commands are intended to be run in the root of the Sui repo. You can also run them within the `apps/explorer` directory, and remove change `pnpm explorer` to just `pnpm` when running commands.

## Developing the Sui Explorer

To start the explorer dev server, you can run the following command:

```
pnpm explorer dev
```

This will start the dev server on port 3000, which should be accessible on http://localhost:3000/

# How to Switch Environment

By default, the Sui Explorer attempts to connect to a local RPC server. For more information about using a local RPC server, see [Local RPC Server & JSON-RPC API Quick Start](../../doc/src/build/json-rpc.md).

If you want to use the explorer with another network, you can select your preferred network in the header of the explorer.

## To run end-to-end localnet test

Start validators locally:

```bash
cargo run --bin sui-test-validator
```

In a a separate terminal, you can now run the end-to-end tests:

```bash
pnpm explorer playwright test
```

# Other pnpm commands

### `pnpm explorer test`

This runs a series of end-to-end browser tests using the website as connected to the static JSON dataset. This command is run by the GitHub checks. The tests must pass before merging a branch into main.

### `pnpm explorer build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.

It bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

### `pnpm explorer lint`

Run linting check (prettier/eslint).

### `pnpm explorer lint:fix`

Run linting check but also try to fix any issues.
