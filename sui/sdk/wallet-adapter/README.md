Sui Wallet Adapter is a set of libraries that makes it easy to connect your dApp to Sui wallets.

## Getting started

We recommend using [Sui Wallet Kit](./wallet-kit/README.md) for connecting to wallets from React applications.

If you're not using React, you can use the underlying [wallet adapter packages](./adapters/) to determine which wallets are currently available in the dApp, and interact with the wallets.
