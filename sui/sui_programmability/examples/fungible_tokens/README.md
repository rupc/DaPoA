# Fungible Tokens

* MANAGED: a token managed by a treasurer trusted for minting and burning. This is how (e.g.) a fiat-backed stablecoin or an in-game virtual currency would work.
* BASKET: a synthetic token backed by a basket of other assets. This how (e.g.) a [Special Drawing Rights (SDR)](https://www.imf.org/en/About/Factsheets/Sheets/2016/08/01/14/51/Special-Drawing-Right-SDR)-like asset would work.
* REGULATED_COIN: a coin managed by a central authority which can freeze accounts
* PRIVATE_COIN: a coin which has the option of hiding the amount that you transact
* PRIVATE_BALANCE: a balance which has the option of hiding the amount that it stores.
* FIXED: a token with a fixed supply (coming in future).
* ALGO: a token with an algorithmic issuance policy (coming in future).
