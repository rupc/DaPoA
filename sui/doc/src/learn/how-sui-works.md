title: How Sui Works
---

This document is written for engineers, developers, and technical readers knowledgeable about the blockchain. It does not assume deep programming language or distributed systems expertise. See the [Sui white paper](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/blob/main/doc/paper/sui.pdf) for a much deeper explanation of how Sui works. See [How Sui Differs from Other Blockchains](sui-compared.md) for a high-level overview of the differences between Sui and other blockchain systems.

## Overview

The Sui blockchain is reshaping the industry by achieving unprecedented speed and scalability. Its innovative approach takes advantage of the fact that a large number of blockchain transactions involve non-overlapping states, which allows for parallel processing. Additionally, Sui optimizes for single-writer objects, removing the need for consensus in simple transactions.

Unlike traditional blockchains which rely on fire-and-forget broadcasts, Sui's design enables requestors or proxies to proactively communicate with validators to finalize transactions, resulting in near-instant finality. With such low latency, Sui is a key enabler to incorporating transactions into games and other settings that require real-time completion.

Sui also supports smart contracts written in Move, a language designed for blockchains with strong inherent security and a more understandable programming model.

In a world where the cost of bandwidth is diminishing steadily, we are creating an ecosystem of services that will find it easy, fun, and perhaps profitable to ensure transaction voting on behalf of users.

## Components

Become familiar with these key Sui concepts:

* [Objects](../learn/objects.md) - Sui has programmable objects created and managed by Move packages (a.k.a. smart contracts). Move packages themselves are also objects. Thus, Sui objects can be partitioned into two categories: mutable data values and immutable packages.
* [Transactions](../learn/transactions.md) - All updates to the Sui ledger happen via a transaction. This section describes the transaction types supported by Sui and explains how their execution changes the ledger.
* [Validators](../learn/architecture/validators.md) - The Sui network is operated by a set of independent validators, each running its own instance of the Sui software on a separate machine (or a cluster of machines operated by the same entity).

## Architecture

Sui is a distributed ledger that stores a collection of programmable [objects](../learn/objects.md), each with a globally unique ID. Every object is owned by a single *address*, and each address can own an arbitrary number of objects.

The ledger is updated via a [transaction](../learn/transactions.md) sent by a particular address. A transaction can create, destroy, and write objects, as well as transfer them to other addresses.

Structurally, a transaction contains a set of input object references and a pointer to a Move code object that already exists in the ledger. Executing a transaction produces updates to the input objects and (if applicable) a set of freshly created objects along with their owner addresses. A transaction with address *A* as a sender can accept either (a) objects owned by *A*, (b) shared objects, or (c) objects that are owned by other objects which satisfy case (a) or case (b).

The validators on the Sui blockchain do not require consensus to process transactions involving exclusively owned objects. Instead, they execute transactions in parallel at high throughput, utilizing [Byzantine Consistent Broadcast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_fault). For objects that involve shared objects, the validators employ [Bullshark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.05633), a high-throughput DAG-base consensus protocol.

## System Overview

This section is written for a technical audience wishing to gain more insight into how Sui achieves its main performance and security objectives.

Sui assumes the typical blockchain transaction is a user-to-user transfer or asset manipulation and optimizes for that scenario. As a result, Sui distinguishes between two types of assets:(i) owned objects that can be modified only by their specific owner and hence should never be under contention, and (ii) shared objects that have no specific owners and can be modified by more than one user. This distinction allows for a design that achieves very low latency by foregoing [consensus](architecture/consensus.md) for simple transactions involving only owned objects.

In Sui, [consensus](architecture/consensus.md) is only required when the transaction involves shared objects. For this, Sui employs the [Narwhal DAG-based mempool](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.11827) and an efficient Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) consensus via Bullshark. When shared objects are involved, the Sui validators play a similar role to validators in other blockchains and totally order transactions accessing shared objects.

Because Sui focuses on managing specific objects rather than a single aggregation of states, it also reports on them in a unique way: (i) every object in Sui has a unique version number, and (ii) every new version is created from a transaction that may involve several dependencies, themselves versioned objects.

As a consequence, a Sui validator – or any other entity with a copy of the state – can exhibit a causal history of an object, showing its history since genesis. Sui explicitly makes the bet that in many cases, the ordering of that causal history with the causal history of another object is irrelevant; and in the few cases where this information is relevant, Sui makes this relationship explicit in the data.

Sui guarantees transaction processing obeys [eventual consistency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eventual_consistency) in the [classic sense](https://hal.inria.fr/inria-00609399/document). This breaks down into two parts:

* Eventual delivery - if one honest validator processes a transaction, all other honest validators will eventually do the same.
* Convergence - two validators that have seen the same set of transactions share the same view of the system (reach the same state).

But contrary to a blockchain, Sui does not stop the flow of transactions in order to witness the convergence until the end of an epoch.

## Transactions on single-owner objects

[Many transactions](https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/611.pdf) such as coin or object transfers, NFT minting, and smart contract publishing can be expressed as operations on _single-owner_ objects that can be used in transactions by only one address at a time. Sui automatically recognizes such transactions and leverages this observation to forgo [consensus](https://pmg.csail.mit.edu/papers/osdi99.pdf). Instead, Sui uses simpler algorithms based on [Byzantine Consistent Broadcast](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-642-15260-3). See our list of potential [single-writer apps](single-writer-apps.md) for examples of real-world simple transactions.

Our single-owner object protocol is based on the [FastPay](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.11506) design that comes with peer-reviewed security guarantees. In a nutshell, Sui takes the approach of taking a lock (or "stopping the world") only for the relevant piece of data rather than the whole chain. This enables parallel transaction submission and execution on a massive scale.

Sui further expands this approach to more involved transactions that may explicitly depend on multiple elements under their sender's control, using Move’s object model and leveraging Move's strong ownership model. By requiring that dependencies be explicit, Sui applies a _multi-lane_ approach to transaction validation, making sure those independent transaction flows can progress without interference or synchronization.

Sui validates transactions individually, rather than batching them into traditional blocks. The key advantage of this approach is low latency; each successful transaction quickly obtains a certificate of finality that proves to anyone that the transaction will be processed by the Sui network.

Submitting a Sui transaction involves the following steps. These are transparent to the transaction sender, but it's worth understanding what happens behind the scenes:

1. Users send transactions to a *quorum driver*, such as a Full node, that broadcasts the transactions to a set of validators.
2. Each Sui validator performs validity checks on transactions and adds a signature to valid ones. Each signature is weighted proportionally to the amount staked with the validator. 
3. The quorum driver collects signatures with a combined weight greater than or equal to 2/3 of the total stake (quorum of stake) into a _certificate_ and broadcasts it to all Sui validators.
4. When a validator receives a certificate, the validator verifies the certificate. If the certificate is valid, the validator then executes the embedded transaction and returns signed _transaction effects_ to the quorum driver. A transaction becomes _final_ after a quorum of validators receive and execute the corresponding certificate.
5. Optionally, the quorum driver can collect an _effects certificate_ based on the previous step and return it to the sender as proof of finality.

While this may sound like a lot of steps, this process allows each validator to perform the operations above in parallel without coordination--observe that none of the preceding steps require validators to communicate with each other! This significantly reduces the communication cost of committing a transaction compared to a conventional blockchain that requires O(n^2) communication among validators before achieving transaction finality.

Finally, note that the role of quorum driver does not require access to any private keys, and can safely be delegated to a third party, such as a Full node, an RPC provider, or a custodial wallet.

## Transactions on shared objects

Many use-cases require *shared* objects that can be manipulated by two or more addresses at once--such as an auction with open bidding, or a central limit order book that accepts arbitrary trades. In such cases, Sui must sequence transactions that manipulate the same shared object using a [consensus](architecture/consensus.md) protocol. Sui uses [Narwhal](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.11827) for high-throughput, horizontally scalable transaction dissemination and [Bullshark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.05633) for zero message overhead consensus.

For transactions involving one or more shared objects, the process is as described above up to step (4), where instead:
1. When a validator receives a certificate and validates it, the validator uses Narwhal to submit the certificate to Bullshark for sequencing.
2. After Sui sequences the transaction, it executes it to produce effects using the same flow as (5) above.

## Scalability

As mentioned, Sui does not impose a total order on the transactions containing only owned objects. Instead, transactions are [causally ordered](sui-compared.md#causal-order-vs-total-order). If a transaction `T1` produces an output object `O1` used as input object in a transaction `T2`, a validator must execute `T1` before it executes `T2`. Note that `T2` does not need to use these objects directly for a causal relationship to exist, e.g., `T1` might produce output objects that are then used by `T3`, and `T2` might use `T3`'s output objects. However, transactions with no causal relationship can be processed by Sui validators in any order. This insight allows Sui to massively parallelize execution, and shard it across multiple machines.

Sui employs the [state-of-the-art Bullshark consensus protocol](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.05633) to totally order transactions involving shared objects. The consensus sub-system also scales in the sense that it can sequence more transactions by adding more machines per validator.

## Smart contract programming

Sui smart contracts are written in the [Move language](https://github.com/MystenLabs/awesome-move/blob/main/README.md). Move is safe and expressive, and its type system and data model naturally support the parallel agreement/execution strategies that make Sui scalable. Move is an open-source programming language for building smart contracts originally developed at [Meta](http://meta.com) for the [Diem blockchain](https://www.diem.com). The language is platform-agnostic, and in addition to being adopted by Sui, it has been gaining popularity on other platforms (e.g., [0L](https://0l.network), [StarCoin](https://starcoin.org/en/)).
