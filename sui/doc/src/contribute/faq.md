This page contains answers to frequently asked questions (FAQs) about Sui and Mysten Labs.

## What does Sui offer over other blockchains?

Sui offers ease of development, a developer interface, fast transaction speeds, a sane object model, and better security. Sui calls the [consensus protocol](../learn/architecture/consensus.md) only for transactions affecting objects owned by multiple addresses. This means simple transactions complete almost immediately.

## Is Sui based on Diem?

There is no technical relationship between Diem and Sui except that both use Move.

All five co-founders (as well as several Mysten employees) worked on the Diem system and are very familiar with both its good qualities and its limitations. Diem was designed to handle light payments traffic between a small number (10s-100s) of custodial wallets. There were eventual visions of evolving it into a more scalable system that is capable of handling more general-purpose smart contracts; however, the original architecture was not designed to support this and has not evolved significantly.

When we started Mysten, we had the option to build on top of Diem but chose not to because of these limitations. We believe blockchain technology has evolved a lot since Diem came out in 2019, and we have many ideas about how to design a system that is more scalable and programmer-friendly from the ground up. That is why we built Sui.


## What is the relationship between Sui/Mysten and Aptos?

There is no relationship between Sui/Mysten and Aptos. The similarity is that they both use Move; but Sui has a different object model. The research behind the [block STM paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.06871) was all done at Facebook. Subsequently, some of the authors joined Mysten and some joined Aptos. The paper carries the current affiliations of the authors.

## Can I buy Sui tokens?

We will have a public token, called SUI, for the Sui Mainnet. But it is not available right now and there is no timeline as of yet. Anyone who claims otherwise (offering tokens, whitelists, pre-sale, etc.) is running a scam.


### When is the Sui Devnet/Testnet/Mainnet launching?

We launched our [Sui Devnet](../build/devnet.md) in May 2022. We'll release a Testnet when it's ready.

## How can I join the Sui network? How do I participate in the Sui project?

Join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/sui) and follow our [Twitter](https://twitter.com/SuiNetwork) for the latest updates and announcements.

You can also join the [Move](https://discord.gg/8prNjUqyFj) and [Sui](https://discord.gg/CVcnUzKYCB) developer channels in Discord.

## Are you looking for partners?

We are seeking partners that can contribute to the ecosystem, primarily in development, by building apps with the SDK now so they can be ready to launch when the network goes live. If interested, please apply using the [Sui Partnerships Form](https://bit.ly/suiform).

## Do you need moderators in Discord? Can I be the mod for my country?

The Sui Community Mod Program is officially accepting applications. [Apply here](https://bit.ly/suimods)

## How do I request a Mysten Labs speaker for an event?

Ask in Discord.

## After I publish a Move package, how do I update it?

Packages are immutable objects, and this property is relied upon in several places. To update the package you need to publish an updated package.

## Is there any information on node architecture and running validators on Sui?

See the [Sui Smart Contract Platform](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/blob/main/doc/paper/sui.pdf) for node architecture information.

See the instructions to [run a Sui Fullnode](../build/fullnode.md).

## Can I run a Sui validator node?

The public [Sui Devnet](../build/devnet.md) includes nodes operated by Mysten Labs. You can set up and run a [Sui Fullnode](../build/fullnode.md). We will publish a Validator Guide when appropriate.

## Is Sui compatible with Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)?

No. Sui heavily leverages the Move's asset-centric data model for its novel parallel execution and commitment scheme. This is simply not possible with the EVM data model. Because assets are represented as entries in dynamically indexable maps, it is not possible to statically determine which assets a transaction will touch.

To be blunt: even if we preferred the EVM/Solidity to Move, we could not use them in Sui without sacrificing the performance breakthroughs that make Sui unique. And of course, we think there are many reasons why Move is a safer and more developer-friendly language than the EVM.

See [Why move?](../learn/why-move.md) for more details on this. In addition, see the [Move Problem Statement](https://github.com/MystenLabs/awesome-move/blob/main/docs/problem_statement.md) for why we think that - despite being the most popular smart contract language of today - EVM is holding back the crypto space.

Finally, the EVM developer community is very small--approximately 4,000 programmers according to [this study](https://medium.com/electric-capital/electric-capital-developer-report-2021-f37874efea6d). Compare this to (e.g.) the [>20M registered iOS developers](https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/04/app-store-hits-20m-registered-developers-at-100b-in-revenues-500m-visitors-per-week). Thus, the practical path to scaling the smart contract dev community is to bring folks in from the broader population, not to pull them from the tiny pool of existing Solidity developers. We think Move is much safer and much more approachable for mainstream programmers than the EVM.

## Is Sui an L2, or are there plans to support L2s?

Sui tackles scaling at the base layer rather than via L2s. We think this approach leads to a more user and developer-friendly system than adding additional complexity on top of an already-complex base layer that doesn't scale.


## Does Mysten maintain a fork of Move?

No. Move is designed to be a cross-platform language that can be used anywhere you need safe smart contracts. There are some more details on how this works + the chains Move runs in the [Awesome Move](https://github.com/MystenLabs/awesome-move) documentation.
