title: End-to-End Tutorial to Set Up and Play TicTacToe on Sui
---

In this tutorial, we demonstrate the end-to-end process for starting a
Sui network locally, connecting to it through our [CLI client](../build/cli-client.md)
app, publishing a TicTacToe game written in [Move](../build/move/index.md) on Sui,
and playing it to the end.

## Set up

1. [Install Sui binaries](../build/install.md#install-or-update-sui-binaries) and
   [download Sui source code](../build/install.md#source-code).
1. [Create Sui genesis](../build/cli-client.md#genesis) by running the
   `sui genesis` command.
1. [Start the Sui network](../build/cli-client.md#starting-the-network) by
   running the `sui start` command.

After completing these steps, you will have a running local Sui instance and
the `sui client` command used in the remainder of this tutorial in your path.
Simply leave the terminal with Sui running and start a new terminal for the
remainder of this tutorial.

This tutorial models gas fees under a simplified schema. In practice, the Sui
network charges for gas using its native currency SUI. This transaction fee
equals the computational effort of executing operations on the Sui network (i.e.
gas units) times the price of gas in the SUI currency (i.e. the gas price).

When you complete the setup steps, you can either use the following script to publish and run the sample code, or perform each step manually. Using the script is optional. To manually run each step, follow the steps starting in the [Gather addresses and gas objects](#gather-addresses-and-gas-objects) section.

## Quick script
If you prefer not to enter command step by step, or need to go through it multiple
times (such as when you change some Move source code), the following automated script
may be useful to save some time.
Run this script from the project repo root.
```sh
#!/bin/bash
# a bash script to automate the process of publishing the game package
# this script should be run at root of the repo

# assign address
CLIENT_ADDRESS=$(sui client addresses | tail -n +2)
ADMIN=`echo "${CLIENT_ADDRESS}" | head -n 1`
PLAYER_X=`echo "${CLIENT_ADDRESS}" | sed -n 2p`
PLAYER_O=`echo "${CLIENT_ADDRESS}" | sed -n 3p`
# gas id
IFS='|'
ADMIN_GAS_INFO=$(sui client gas --address $ADMIN | sed -n 3p)
read -a tmparr <<< "$ADMIN_GAS_INFO"
ADMIN_GAS_ID=`echo ${tmparr[0]} | xargs`

X_GAS_INFO=$(sui client gas --address $PLAYER_X | sed -n 3p)
read -a tmparr <<< "$X_GAS_INFO"
X_GAS_ID=`echo ${tmparr[0]} | xargs`

O_GAS_INFO=$(sui client gas --address $PLAYER_O | sed -n 3p)
read -a tmparr <<< "$O_GAS_INFO"
O_GAS_ID=`echo ${tmparr[0]} | xargs`

# publish games
certificate=$(sui client publish ./sui_programmability/examples/games --gas $ADMIN_GAS_ID --gas-budget 30000)

package_id_identifier="The newly published package object ID:"
res=$(echo $certificate | awk -v s="$package_id_identifier" 'index($0, s) == 1')
IFS=':'
read -a resarr <<< "$res"
echo ${resarr[1]}
PACKAGE_ID=`echo ${resarr[1]} | xargs`

echo "package id: $PACKAGE_ID"
# Playing TicTacToe

# create a game
sui client call --package $PACKAGE_ID --module tic_tac_toe --function create_game --args $PLAYER_X $PLAYER_O --gas $ADMIN_GAS_ID --gas-budget 1000

# start playing the game ...
```

## Gather addresses and gas objects

In the new terminal session you started, use the following command in the Sui CLI client to view the addresses we own:
```shell
$ sui client addresses
```

Which results in output resembling:
```shell
Showing 5 results.
ECF53CE22D1B2FB588573924057E9ADDAD1D8385
7B61DA6AACED7F28C1187D998955F10464BEAE55
251CF224B6BA3A019D04B6041357C20490F7A322
DB4C7667636471AFF396B900EB7B63FACAF629B6
A6BBB1930E01495EE93CE912EA01C29695E07890
```
Note that since these addresses are randomly generated, they are different from the values you see when you run the command. We need three addresses to play TicTacToe. Let's pick the first three addresses. Let's call them ADMIN, PLAYER_X and PLAYER_O.

Since we will be using these addresses and gas objects repeatedly in the rest of this tutorial, let's make them environment variables so that we don't have to retype them every time:
```
$ export ADMIN=ECF53CE22D1B2FB588573924057E9ADDAD1D8385
export PLAYER_X=7B61DA6AACED7F28C1187D998955F10464BEAE55
export PLAYER_O=251CF224B6BA3A019D04B6041357C20490F7A322
```

For each of these addresses, let's discover the gas objects associated with each address:
```
$ sui client gas --address $ADMIN
                Object ID                 |  Version   |  Gas Value
----------------------------------------------------------------------

                Object ID                 |  Version   |  Gas Value
----------------------------------------------------------------------
 2110ADFB7BAF889A05EA6F5889AF7724299F9BED |     0      |   100000
 8C04A5D8D62155B9E90093D6CB300DA304B9E581 |     0      |   100000
 9602B7C0869E7E5AB314FB3D99395A8C640E0E34 |     0      |   100000
 A0DBF58C3801EC2FEDA1D039E190A6B31A25B199 |     0      |   100000
 D5EBB8A19A35874A18B7A1D883EBFC8D897F5693 |     0      |   100000
```
We only need one gas object per address. So let's pick the first gas object of each address. In the above example, it's `38B89FE9F4A4823F1406938E87A8767CBD7F0B93`, `6F675038CAA48184707DBBE95ACFBA2030E87CD8` and `2110ADFB7BAF889A05EA6F5889AF7724299F9BED`, respectively. Again, you will see different IDs. Let's also add them to our environment variables:
```
$ export ADMIN_GAS=38B89FE9F4A4823F1406938E87A8767CBD7F0B93
export X_GAS=6F675038CAA48184707DBBE95ACFBA2030E87CD8
export O_GAS=2110ADFB7BAF889A05EA6F5889AF7724299F9BED
```

## Publish the TicTacToe game on Sui
To keep this tutorial simple, use the TicTacToe game we implemented in [tic_tac_toe.move](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/blob/main/sui_programmability/examples/games/sources/tic_tac_toe.move).

Find even more [examples](examples.md) in the Sui repository. Of course, you are welcome to
[write your own package](../build/move/write-package.md).

To publish the game, we run the publish command and specify the path to the source code of the game package:
```shell
$ sui client publish ./sui/sui_programmability/examples/games --gas $ADMIN_GAS --gas-budget 30000
```

Which yields results resembling:
```shell
----- Certificate ----
Signed Authorities : ...
Transaction Kind : Publish
Gas Budget : 30000
----- Publish Results ----
The newly published package object: (A613A7FF8CB03E0DFC0D157E232BBA50C5F19D17, SequenceNumber(1), o#fb70b9d1ac25250a00e35031289f89cd9c9d739f8663e1cc8ed739095a104e68)
List of objects created by running module initializers: []
Updated Gas : Coin { id: 38B89FE9F4A4823F1406938E87A8767CBD7F0B93, value: 92939 }
```
As we can see, the package was successfully published. Some gas was charged: the initial gas value was 100000, now it's 92939 (note: the current gas charging mechanism is rather arbitrary, we will come up with a gas mechanism shortly).
The newly published package has the ID `A613A7FF8CB03E0DFC0D157E232BBA50C5F19D17`. Note that this ID will also be different in your terminal. We add the package to another environment variable:
```
export PACKAGE=A613A7FF8CB03E0DFC0D157E232BBA50C5F19D17
```

## Playing TicTacToe
As we mentioned earlier, we need 3 parties to participate in this game: Admin, PlayerX and PlayerO.
At a high level, the game works as following:
1. The admin creates a game, which also specifies the addresses of the two players. This will also create two capability objects and send to each of the addresses to give them permission to participate in the same game. This ensures that an arbitrary person cannot attempt to join this game.
2. Each player takes turns to send a *Mark* object to the admin indicating where they want to place their mark.
3. The admin, upon receiving marks (in practice, this is done through monitoring events), places the mark to the gameboard.
4. (2) and (3) repeats until game ends.
Because the admin owns the gameboard, each individual player cannot place a mark directly on the gameboard (they don't own the object, and hence cannot mutate it, see [Object Model](../learn/objects.md)), each mark placement is split to 2 steps, that each player first sends a mark, and then the admin places the mark. A sample gameplay can also be found in the [tic_tac_toe_tests](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/blob/main/sui_programmability/examples/games/tests/tic_tac_toe_tests.move) file.

Now let's begin the game!
First of all, let's create a game with the command:
```shell
$ sui client call --package $PACKAGE --module tic_tac_toe --function create_game --args $PLAYER_X $PLAYER_O --gas $ADMIN_GAS --gas-budget 1000
```

You will see output like:
```shell

The preceding call created three objects. For each object, it printed out a tuple of three values (object_id, version, object_digest). Object ID is what we care about here. Since we don't have a real application here to display things for us, we need a bit of object printing magic to figure out which object is which. Let's print out the metadata of each created object (replace the object ID with what you see on your screen):
```
$ sui client object 5851B7EA07B93E68696BC0CF811D2E266DFB880D

Readonly: false
Type: 0xa613a7ff8cb03e0dfc0d157e232bba50c5f19d17::TicTacToe::TicTacToe
```
There are two MarkMintCap objects (for capability of minting a mark for each player) and a TicTacToe object (the game object). Take a look at each of the `Owner` fields, and you will see that:
1. MarkMintCap Object `5851B7EA07B93E68696BC0CF811D2E266DFB880D` is owned by PLAYER_O.
2. MarkMintCap Object `A6D3B507D4533822E690291166891D42694A2721` is owned by PLAYER_X.
3. TicTacToe Object `F1B8161BD97D3CD6627E739AD675089C5ACFB452` is owned by ADMIN.

We add the above three object IDs to these environment variables:
```
$ export XCAP=A6D3B507D4533822E690291166891D42694A2721
export OCAP=5851B7EA07B93E68696BC0CF811D2E266DFB880D
export GAME=F1B8161BD97D3CD6627E739AD675089C5ACFB452
```

By convention, PlayerX goes first. PlayerX wants to put a mark at the center of the gameboard ((1, 1)). This needs to take two steps. First PlayerX creates a Mark object with the placement intention and send it to the admin.
We will call the `send_mark_to_game` function in `TicTacToe`, whose signature looks like this:
```
public entry fun send_mark_to_game(cap: &mut MarkMintCap, game_address: address, row: u64, col: u64, ctx: &mut TxContext);
```
The `cap` argument will be PlayerX's capability object (XCAP), and `game_address` argument will be the admin's address (ADMIN):
```shell
$ sui client call --package $PACKAGE --module tic_tac_toe --function send_mark_to_game --args $XCAP $ADMIN 1 1 --gas $X_GAS --gas-budget 1000
```
And its output:
```shell

```
The above call created a Mark object, with ID `AE3CE9176F1A8C1F21D922722486DF667FA00394`, and it was sent to the admin.
The admin can now place the mark on the gameboard. The function to place the mark looks like this:
```
public entry fun place_mark(game: &mut TicTacToe, mark: Mark, ctx: &mut TxContext);
```
The first argument is the game board, and the second argument is the mark the admin just received from the player. We will call this function (replace the second argument with the Mark object ID above):
```shell
$ sui client call --package $PACKAGE --module tic_tac_toe --function place_mark --args $GAME 0xAE3CE9176F1A8C1F21D922722486DF667FA00394 --gas $ADMIN_GAS --gas-budget 1000
```
The gameboard now looks like this (this won't be printed out, so keep it in your imagination):
```
_|_|_
_|X|_
 | |
```

PlayerO now tries to put a mark at (0, 0):
```shell
$ sui client call --package $PACKAGE --module tic_tac_toe --function send_mark_to_game --args $OCAP $ADMIN 0 0 --gas $O_GAS --gas-budget 1000
```

With output like:

...
```

Note, in this second call, the second argument comes from the created objects in the first call.
```shell
$ sui client call --package $PACKAGE --module tic_tac_toe --function place_mark --args $GAME 0x7A16D266DAD41145F34649258BC1F744D147BF2F --gas $ADMIN_GAS --gas-budget 1000

...
```
The gameboard now looks like this:
```
O|_|_
_|X|_
 | |
```

PlayerX puts a mark at (0, 2):
```shell
$ sui client call --package $PACKAGE --module tic_tac_toe --function send_mark_to_game --args $XCAP $ADMIN 0 2 --gas $X_GAS --gas-budget 1000
```

With output like:

```

Then run:
```shell
$ sui client call --package $PACKAGE --module tic_tac_toe --function place_mark --args $GAME 0x2875D50BD9021ED2009A1278C7CB6D4C876FFF6A --gas $ADMIN_GAS --gas-budget 1000
```

The gameboard now looks like this:
```
O|_|X
_|X|_
 | |
```

PlayerO places a mark at (1, 0):
```shell
$ sui client call --package $PACKAGE --module tic_tac_toe --function send_mark_to_game --args $OCAP $ADMIN 1 0 --gas $O_GAS --gas-budget 1000
```

With output like:

```

Now run:
```shell
$ sui client call --package $PACKAGE --module tic_tac_toe --function place_mark --args $GAME 0x4F7391F172063D87013DD9DC95B8BD45C35FD2D9 --gas $ADMIN_GAS --gas-budget 1000
...
```
The gameboard now looks like:
```
O|_|X
O|X|_
 | |
```
This is a chance for PlayerX to win! X now mints the winning mark at (2, 0):
```shell
$ sui client call --package $PACKAGE --module tic_tac_toe --function send_mark_to_game --args $XCAP $ADMIN 2 0 --gas $X_GAS --gas-budget 1000
```

And its output:
```shell

```

And then finally the admin places the winning mark:
```shell
   $ sui client call --package $PACKAGE --module tic_tac_toe --function place_mark --args $GAME 0xAA7A6624E16E5E447801462FF6614013FC4AD156 --gas $ADMIN_GAS --gas-budget 1000

Cool! The last transaction created a new object. Let's find out what object was created:
```shell
$ sui client object 54B58C0D5B14A269B1CD424B3CCAB1E315C43343
```

See output resembling:
```shell
