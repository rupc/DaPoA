title: Install Sui to Build
---

Learn how to install and configure Sui to develop smart contracts on the Sui blockchain.

Before you install Sui, you need to install some prerequisite tools and configure your development environment.

The steps to install Sui include:

1. Install [prerequisites](#prerequisites) for your operating system.
1. Install the [Sui binaries](#install-or-update-sui-binaries).
1. Configure an [Integrated Development Environment (IDE)](#integrated-development-environment).
1. Request [SUI tokens](#sui-tokens) to evaluate Devnet and Sui Wallet.
1. Optionally, download the [source code](#source-code) to have local
   access to examples and contribute to Sui.

## Sui repository

The Sui repository includes two primary branches, `devnet` and `main`.

 * The `devnet` branch includes the latest stable build of Sui. Choose the `devnet` branch if you want to build or test on Sui. If you encounter an issue or find a bug, it may already be fixed in the `main` branch. To submit a pull request (PR), you should push commits to your fork of the `main` branch.
 * The `main` branch includes the most recent changes and updates. Use the `main` branch if you want to contribute to the Sui project. The `main` branch may include unreleased changes, or introduce changes that cause issues in apps created using an earlier version.

## Documentation in the Sui repository

The `main` and `devnet` branches of the Sui repository contain the relevant documentation for each branch. A version toggle on the documentation site enables you to switch between `main` branch content (labeled **Latest build**) and `devnet` branch content (labeled **Devnet**). Make sure the toggle is set to **Devnet** for to learn how to install, configure, and build on Sui. The content in **Latest build** is useful to learn about potential updates to Sui, but the features and functionality described might not ever become available in the `devnet` branch.  

## Supported operating systems

Sui supports the following operating systems, beginning with the versions indicated.

* Linux - Ubuntu version 20.04 (Bionic Beaver)
* macOS - macOS Monterey
* Microsoft Windows - Windows 11

### Rust and Cargo

Sui requires Rust and Cargo (Rust's package manager) on all supported operating systems. Some operating systems require cURL to download Rust and Cargo, so check the relevant prerequisite section to install cURL first, if necessary.

Use the following command to install Rust and Cargo on macOS or Linux:
```shell
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

Windows 11 users can use the [Rust installer](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) available on the Rust website. The installer detects if you do not have the required C++ build tools and prompts you to install. Select the option that best defines your environment and follow the instructions in the install wizard. 

For additional installation options, see [Install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) on the Rust website.

Sui uses the latest version of Cargo to build and manage dependencies. See the [Cargo installation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html) page on the Rust website for more information.

Use the following command to update Rust:

```shell
rustup update stable
```

After you install Rust, proceed to the prerequisites for your operating system.
 * [Linux prerequisites](#linux-prerequisites)

### Additional tools for Windows

Sui requires the following additional tools on computers running Windows.

 * For Windows on ARM64 only - [Visual Studio 2022 Preview](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/preview/).
 * [C++ build tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) are required to [install Rust](#rust-and-cargo), so you should already have these installed if you followed these instructions.
 * The [LLVM Compiler Infrastructure](https://releases.llvm.org/).

If the progress appears to freeze, press **Enter** in the command prompt to fix the issue.

**Known issue** - The `sui console` command does not work in PowerShell.

## Install (or update) Sui binaries <a name="binaries"></a>

With Cargo installed, use the following command to install or update the sui executable:

```shell
cargo install --locked --git https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui.git --branch devnet sui
```

The command installs the following Sui components in `~/.cargo/bin`:
* [`sui`](cli-client.md) - The Sui CLI tool contains subcommands for enabling `genesis` of validators and accounts, starting the Sui network, and [building and testing Move packages](move/index.md), as well as a [client](cli-client.md) for interacting with the Sui network.

Install procedure to expect: (40min (depends on the RAM you have available for the build process))
- update git repository
- update crates.io index
- compile (~1850) dependencies
- (replace the previous version of the 'sui' package with the new one)

Throubleshooting:
* make sure you have the latest version of Rust installed:
```
rustup update stable
source "$HOME/.cargo/env"
```
* reach out on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/sui)

### macOS and Linux

Confirm the binaries are installed with `.cargo/bin` appearing in your PATH variable:
```
echo $PATH
```
### Windows

Confirm the binaries are installed with `.cargo\bin` appearing in your PATH variable:
```
echo %PATH%
```
Use the `--help` flag to access helpful information for any of these binaries.

**Important** - Make sure your entire toolchain stays up-to-date. If you encounter issues building and installing the Sui binaries, update all packages and re-install.

## Integrated development environment

The recommended IDE for Move development is [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the move-analyzer extension. Follow the Visual Studio Marketplace instructions to install the [move-analyzer extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=move.move-analyzer), then install the move-analyzer language server passing `address20` using the `--features` flag:

```shell
cargo install --git https://github.com/move-language/move move-analyzer --features "address20"
```

See more [IDE options](https://github.com/MystenLabs/awesome-move#ides) in the [Awesome Move](https://github.com/MystenLabs/awesome-move) documentation.

## SUI tokens

To [experiment with Devnet](../build/devnet.md) or [use the Sui Wallet browser extension](../explore/wallet-browser.md), add SUI tokens to your account address. 

To request SUI test tokens from the browser extension:

1. Use the Sui Wallet browser extension to open your wallet.
1. Click **Request Sui Devnet Tokens**.

To request SUI test tokens in Discord:

1. Join the [Sui Discord](https://discord.com/invite/sui) If you haven’t already.
1. Identify your address through either the Sui Wallet browser extension or by running the following command and electing to connect to a Sui RPC server if prompted:
   ```shell
   sui client active-address
   ```
1. Request tokens in the [#devnet-faucet](https://discord.com/channels/916379725201563759/971488439931392130) channel using the syntax: `!faucet <YOUR_ADDRESS>`, for example:
      ```shell
      !faucet 0xd72c2c90ed9d923cb0ed2ca91db5be9e1c9b5ccb
      ```
1. A bot on the channel distributes tokens to you automatically.

## Help

To contribute updates to Sui code, [send pull requests](../contribute/index.md#send-pull-requests) our way.

> **Note:** The previous `git clone` command syncs with the `devnet` branch, which makes sure the source code is compatible with our Devnet. If you want to run a network locally using the latest version and don't need to interact with our Devnet, you should switch to `main` branch.
