title: Connect to the Sui Network
---

The pages in this section provide various options for communicating with Sui:

* Use the [Sui JSON-RPC API](json-rpc.md) to interact with a Sui network.
* Use the [Sui CLI client](cli-client.md).
* Interact with the Sui network via the [Sui Rust SDK](rust-sdk.md), a collection of Rust language JSON-RPC wrapper and crypto utilities.
* Sign transactions and interact with the Sui network using the [Sui TypeScript SDK](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/tree/main/sdk/typescript) built on the Sui JSON RPC API.
* Run a [Sui Full node](fullnode.md) yourself to store the full Sui blockchain state and history.
* Filter and subscribe to a [real-time event stream](event_api.md#subscribe-to-sui-events) on your Sui Full node using the WebSocket API.
* Find SDKs for other languages provided by the community in the [awesome-move](https://github.com/MystenLabs/awesome-move#sdks) overview.

See the [Sui Reference Documentation](../reference/index.md) for information on the Sui API and SuiJSON format.
