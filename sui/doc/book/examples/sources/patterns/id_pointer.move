/// on Sui where `Lock<T>` is a shared object that can contain any object,
/// and `Key` is an owned object which is required to get access to the
/// contents of the lock.
///
/// `Key` is linked to its `Lock` using an `ID` field. This check allows
/// off-chain discovery of the target as well as splits the dynamic
/// transferable capability and the 'static' contents. Another benefit of
/// this approach is that the target asset is always discoverable while its
/// `Key` can be wrapped into another object (eg a marketplace listing).
